Estimation Techniques



You can use one or a combination of these:



Expert Judgment



Consult experienced developers or hospital IT specialists for time and effort estimates.



Analogous Estimation



Compare with similar hospital software projects.



Function Point Analysis



Count inputs, outputs, files, and interfaces to calculate effort.



Story Point \& Agile Estimation



Assign complexity points to user stories and convert points to effort (hours/days) 

Timeline Estimation



Assuming 3–4 developers + 1 QA + 1 Project Manager, a medium system may take roughly 6–9 months from analysis to deployment.



Agile approach: Break into 2–3 month sprints per module.

Cost Estimation (Optional)



Cost depends on resource rates. Example:



Developer: $50–$100/hour



QA: $40–$80/hour



PM: $60–$120/hour



For 20 person-months average at $70/hour:



20 months × 160 hours/month × $70 ≈ $224,000
