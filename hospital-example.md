\## 5. Estimation



\### 5.1 Effort Estimation (Medium Hospital System)



| Module                     | Person-Months | Notes |

|-----------------------------|---------------|-------|

| Patient Management          | 2–3           | Registration, appointments |

| EMR / Patient Records       | 4–5           | Consultation notes, history |

| Billing \& Insurance         | 3–4           | Invoicing, insurance claims |

| Lab Management              | 2–3           | Test requests, results, inventory |

| Pharmacy Management         | 2             | Prescriptions, drug inventory |

| Staff Management            | 1–2           | Scheduling, payroll |

| Reporting \& Analytics       | 2–3           | Operational and clinical reports |

| Security \& Integration      | 2–3           | Access control, HIPAA, interfacing systems |

| \*\*Total\*\*                   | \*\*18–25\*\*     | Medium complexity system |



\### 5.2 Timeline

\- 3–4 developers + QA + Project Manager  

\- Approximate duration: 6–9 months  

\- Agile sprints (2–3 months per module)  



\### 5.3 Cost Estimation (Example)

\- Average rate: $70/hour  

\- Total effort: 20 person-months × 160 hours/month × $70/hour ≈ \*\*$224,000\*\*
