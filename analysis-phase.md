Analysis Phase for a Hospital Project



The analysis phase is the stage where the hospital’s needs, problems, and requirements are thoroughly examined before designing a solution. It ensures that interventions (like software systems, workflow changes, or process improvements) are based on clear evidence and understanding.



1\. Objectives of the Analysis Phase



Identify problems in current hospital operations (e.g., patient flow, billing, record-keeping).



Understand user requirements (doctors, nurses, admin staff, patients).



Define functional and non-functional requirements for new systems or improvements.



Assess constraints (budget, legal, technological, regulatory).



Provide a basis for solution design.



Key Steps in the Analysis Phase



Requirement Gathering



Conduct interviews with stakeholders (doctors, nurses, admin staff).



Observe workflows and hospital operations.



Collect documents like patient records, SOPs, and reports.



Use surveys and questionnaires for staff and patients.



Current System Analysis



Examine existing processes or systems (manual or computerized).



Identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and redundancies.



Map patient flow from admission to discharge.



Analyze resource usage (beds, staff, equipment).



Problem Identification



Identify gaps between current operations and desired performance.



Classify problems as operational, administrative, technical, or clinical.



Prioritize issues based on impact and urgency.



Requirement Analysis



Functional requirements: what the system/process should do (e.g., electronic health records, appointment scheduling).



Non-functional requirements: performance, reliability, usability, security, compliance.



Regulatory requirements: HIPAA, local health laws, patient safety standards.



Feasibility Study



Technical feasibility: Can the hospital implement the solution with current technology?



Economic feasibility: Cost-benefit analysis of proposed solutions.



Operational feasibility: Will staff adapt to the changes?



Schedule feasibility: Time needed to implement changes.



Documentation



Prepare requirement specification documents (RSD).



Include flowcharts, diagrams, and narratives of current vs. proposed processes.



Obtain stakeholder approval before moving to the design phase.

Tools \& Techniques Commonly Used



Flowcharts / Process mapping – visualize patient flow, billing, and lab workflows.



Data analysis – for patient statistics, resource utilization, and staff performance.



SWOT analysis – strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats of current hospital operations.



Interviews and questionnaires – to capture qualitative and quantitative data.



Use case diagrams – to model system interactions (especially for software implementation). 

utcome of Analysis Phase



Clear understanding of hospital needs and problems.



A detailed requirement specification document.



Prioritized list of problems and potential solutions.



Basis for designing and implementing new hospital systems or processes.
